# CS-230-The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In the given scenario, I worked for Creative Technology Solutions, who had a client called The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room had an application called "Draw It or Lose It" that functioned on Android devices. This game contained multiple users and must check if an instance of the game exists each time it ran. The client requested that we implement a solution to make the application function on multiple operating systems, such as MacOS, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When developing this document, I feel as though I did an excellent job of detailing the Development Requirements of the application. In this section, I compared the differences in multiple operating systems in terms of server side development, client side development, and development tools. This section was heavily involved with which programming languages, frameworks, and libraries are associated with each operating system.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When developing the code for Draw It or Lose It, I found the design document to be an incredibly helpful resource. This is due to the fact I had to analyze my thoughts of the code and put them into complete sentences, forcing me to develop a better understanding of the code that I was working to develop. Additionally, developing a deeper understanding of operating systems and their intracacies enabled me to develop a better understanding of how certain programming languages work with different operating systems.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of the software design document, it would be the Design Constraints section. When originally completing this section, my knowledge of operatin platforms was very limited, and as a result I did not complete the section thoroughly. I would correct this shortcoming by answering each prompt in full sentences and delving into further detail. For example, I would have addressed the drawbacks of running a web-based application on a mobile device with an operating system such as iOS or Android, rather than simply stating that a mobile device's operating system may not support the application.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs and implement them into design, I thought first about how The Gaming Room could best fulfill their goal of taking their existing Android application and convert it into a web-based application that may run on all devices, as this was their end goal. Doing so allowed me to think of every part of the design as the document was developed and how each section could help me to accomplish this goal. It is crucial to consider the user's needs when designing because fulfilling that need is the project's primary goal. Every piece of the design that is completed works to achieve this goal, step by step. If the user's needs are not kept in consideration when designing, the finished product may not end up being the solution that the client consulted you to provide in the first place.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My original approach for designing software at the beginning of this project was an incomplete approach. I had merely though of what the application should do and how I could make that happen via coding. It was not until completing the documentation for this project that I discovered the deeper intricacies of software design. Choosing the correct operating system, weighing the pro's and con's of each possible OS, considering licensing and costs, and deciding the correct system architecture were all practices that I learned while developing Draw It or Lose It. In the future, I would read the requirements of the desired application and first consider which architectural pattern may be the best fit for the project at hand. After that consideration would come the decision on which operating system would be best, which would be decided by weighing the positives and negatives of the possible OS's in the particular situation.
